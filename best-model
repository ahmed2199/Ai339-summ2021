The results show that the SVM algorithm has the best accuracy in predicting with a precision value of 95%. The Decision Tree algorithm has a prediction accuracy of 93% . SVM supports both linear and non-linear solutions using kernel trick. SVM handles outliersSVM, and Decision Tree algorithms to get the best predictive model. The model making process was carried out by steps; data collecting, pre-processing, model building, comparison of models, and evaluation.
